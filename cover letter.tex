Dear editors,

We would like to submit our paper Augmenting Empathy with Dyadic Neurofeedback in VR to the fast track of HICSS-52 conference special issue. This paper presents a shared VR space for two-person compassion meditation and dyadic real-time bioadaptations to support deep empathic processes. We hope it showcases the potential for shared VR spaces and biofeedback to augment them, and also forward research into physiological synchrony between two people and how it is related to empathy and social presence. The manuscript has been updated from the HICSS-52 version to include synchrony analysis and bi-directional self-reports.
